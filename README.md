# bootcamp
>Use for module 1

>Focus was to clean up code where possible; to simplify, fix any errors found, and make personal touches based off accessibility and presentation. Left notes in code about changes and issues I couldn't fix. Tried to end most notes with my name, so if this was a group project team members would know who notated or changed what.

>Issues encountered: View and elements shifting depending on screen size, attempted to fix with undesirable results.
